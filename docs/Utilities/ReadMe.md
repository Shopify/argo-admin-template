# Utilities

Utilities are divided into two categories: some provide data, and others make functionality available to the extension. Theyâ€™re accessed through the `api` param in vanilla JS, and additionally through hooks API in React.

### Data utilities

- [Locale](./Locale.md)
- [Data](./Data.md)
- [SessionToken](./SessionToken.md)
