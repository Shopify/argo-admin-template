# Link

Links take users to another place, and usually appear within or directly following a sentence.

In an extension built with Argo, relative links on mobile devices use the Shop domain as the base URL from which you can navigate. For example, https://shop1.myshopify.com is a base URL. Linking to `/admin/products` would navigate to https://shop1.myshopify.com/admin/products.

Links can also be supplied with absolute URLs, e.g. https://shop1.myshopify.com/admin/products.

## Behavior

- ðŸ“± Nest only Text within Link. Other components will be ignored. Nested Text will be used to render the content of the Link

| âœ… Do                                                                     | ðŸ›‘ Don't                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸ“± Use `external` to launch URLs with the device browser                  | Inject Javascript into the URL. This will be blocked. |
| ðŸ–¥ Use `external` to launch URLs in a new browser tab. Use HTTPS for URLs. |                                                       |

    external: true,
  });
  link.appendChild('The best product ever!');

  const logLink = root.createComponent(Link, {
    onPress: () => console.log('I was pressed'),
  });
  logLink.appendChild('I donâ€™t do much.');

  root.appendChild(link);
  root.appendChild(logLink);

  root.mount();
});

        The best product ever!
      </Link>
      <Link onPress={() => console.log('I was pressed.')}>I don't do much.</Link>
    </>
