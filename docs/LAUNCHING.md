# Launching your extension to production

**Note:** Currently, you need to publish a version of your extension before running it on a Shopify store.

Learn how to [test your extension on a Shopify store](./TESTING.md#testing-on-shop).

To test changes without changing the live version of your extension, add it to a test version of your app and publish there. Once your changes are ready, copy the Argo code to the extension on your live app.
